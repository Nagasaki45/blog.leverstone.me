	<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Try <a class="reference external" href="https://dokku.com/">Dokku</a> if you want to run multiple toy web apps on a single server and keep the cost at minimum.</p>
<img alt="Dokku logo with name" src="/images/dokku-logo-with-name.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Let's talk, yet again, about deploying toy web apps.
I wrote about this topic many moons ago (see docker-compose in production <a class="reference external" href="/docker-compose-in-production.html">part 1</a> and <a class="reference external" href="/docker-compose-in-production-part-2.html">part 2</a>), but things have changed and it's time for an update.</p>
<p>The main thing that changed, really, is having much less time to maintain projects and money to keep the servers up.
In the past I had a single virtual server (a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets">Digital Ocean droplet</a>) that ran everything.
It had <a class="reference external" href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a> installed manually, and whenever I added a project, I had to reconfigure it to pass traffic to the port the project was running on.
This, again, was done manually.
The deployment itself was done by running a custom script somewhere, either from the local machine or from CI/CD.
That's pretty old-school, isn't it?
And what about SSL?
Forget it; that was too complicated.</p>
<p>Over time projects started to transition to different platforms that automated the process.
I had projects on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> for years, using their now-retired free dev offering.
The cheapest option at the moment is $5 a month.
Some projects were deployed to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/">Digital Ocean's App Platform</a> which also starts at the same cost.
I found both platform very convenient to use, and although not particularly expensive, the cost ramps up quickly when you have a few projects, and that's without considering having a DB and other services to support the web app.
Last year, I invested some time learning AWS (Amazon Web Services), and in the process, deployed a toy project to <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a>.
In the first year I was on the AWS free tier, but after that the price got really high.
If memory serves the forecast was &gt;$50 a month for a load balancer, two of the smallest server instances possible, and a relational DB.
Two days after the end of the free tier period the project was shut down due to the cost.</p>
<p>A solution was called for hosting my toy projects.
If you read this far, you can understand the requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It needs to be cheap. Ideally, I don't want to consider cost for adding or removing toy projects. A one-server solution sounds good for this.</li>
<li>It needs to be simple and easy to maintain. <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambdas</a> are cheap and, in that sense, might be a good solution for toy projects, but my projects already exist in the form of servers and changing them to Lambda functions is too much effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://dokku.com/">Dokku</a> many years ago, and decided to check it again now.
The tagline is 'An open-source PaaS alternative to Heroku', and based on my good experience with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> it sounds pretty much up my alley.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, I also have good experience with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>.
If only I can have <a class="reference external" href="https://dokku.com/">Dokku</a> running in a Digital Ocean droplet ðŸ¤”</p>
<img alt="Dokku on Digit Ocean" src="/images/dokku-on-digitalocean.png" />
<p>Yes! A quick search reveals a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/catalog/dokku/">one click deployment of Dokku on Digital ocean through their marketplace</a>.
I went for a $12 virtual machine with 1 CPU, 2GB RAM, and 50GB of SSD storage, hoping it will be enough for a handful of projects for a while.
Within 20 minutes I was trying to deploy my first abandoned toy project on my new <a class="reference external" href="https://dokku.com/">Dokku</a> instance.
Another 20 minutes in, and the project was up and running.
Three more projects followed in what amounts to 2-3 hours work.
From these 4 project, 3 were previously deployed to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> using <a class="reference external" href="https://buildpacks.io/">buildpacks</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/">Digital Ocean's App Platform</a> using containers (having a <tt class="docutils literal">Dockerfile</tt> at the root of the repo).
Moving these to the new system was a breeze:
adding a git remote locally and pushing, then on the new server configuring environment variables and <a class="reference external" href="https://dokku.com/docs/deployment/application-deployment/#setting-up-ssl">configuring SSL following the deployment tutorial</a>, followed by creating A tags on my DNS provider, and that's it!</p>
<p>The 4th project was previously on <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a> and backed by a relational DB.
I had the data from the DB exported into JSON before shutting the project down.
I was worried about transitioning it, but found it extremely easy as well!
Adding a DB to it was very simple following the so-far-excellent docs.
It took me a while to wrap my head around loading the backup, but the following did the trick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker ps  <span class="c1"># to find the container ID of my app</span>
docker cp my-backup.json my-app-container-id:/app
dokku enter my-app
<span class="c1"># Now run whatever command within the image to load the data</span>
</pre></div>
<p>One last project is an <a class="reference external" href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>/<a class="reference external" href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> project that was previously deployed on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a> with their custom buildpacks.
I had to containerise the project to make it work with the new system, and that took a while.
Nothing to blame the new system for though.
Just the usual modernisation of an old project.</p>
<p>Do I care about having these project highly available? no.
Do I care about no-downtime deployments? also no.
What about data loss (e.g. losing the DB)? That's not the end of the world either.
<a class="reference external" href="https://dokku.com/">Dokku</a> supports cron jobs, so it might be interesting to explore doing regular DB backups.
Or, alternatively, I can accept the $2.40 per month to enable weekly backups of the entire droplet.
If you do care about these then maybe your toy project is not that much of a toy any more ðŸ˜„.</p>
<p>In summary, all of the deployment stories above are here to say that so far I find <a class="reference external" href="https://dokku.com/">Dokku</a> really easy to work with.
There's no much traffic to any of these projects, so CPU / network / disk usage are low as expected.
Memory usage is constantly around %40-%50.
As long as it doesn't creep up dramatically that's probably fine.
So overall it seems that the transition succeeded.</p>

<p>A tool we use at work to vote on the complexity of tickets (bugs, feature enhancements, tech debt, etc.) It was previously deployed to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/">Digital Ocean's App Platform</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="reference external" href="https://xteams.leverstone.me/">Xteams!</a></h3>
<p>An app I made many years ago when I was playing volleyball with a group of 15-20 people who were too polite to make up teams. I know a few people were still using it until 3-4 years ago (including the coach of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Women Volleyball Team). Have no idea if anyone still does. It was previously deployed to <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a>, and before that to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (I think).</p>

<p>An attempt to play with the WebAudio API that ended up more like an experiment in ajax / websockets. Made when I just started writing code and had no idea what I'm doing. Happy to see it online mainly for nostalgia. Previously deployed on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> but went down when they changed the pricing model because there was no point in paying for it.</p>
